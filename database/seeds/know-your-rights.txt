Passengers generally do not have to identify themselves unless the officer suspects them<br />
of a crime.<br />

citation rather than engaging in debate.<br />

Keep your hands visible, speak respectfully, and avoid sudden movements. This can<br />
prevent the situation from escalating.<br />

leave.<br />

cause. This request should be verbal and calm.<br />

actions later in court or through legal processes.<br />

details of the interaction for future reporting.<br />

location, officer names, badge numbers, and what was said or done.<br />

requests, which you can make through public records in many states.<br />
